Write a complete program which accepts three ints a, b and c from the keyboard, which are the coefficients of a quadratic equation such that b2 > 4ac. (The program keeps looping until the condition is met.) Further, the program calls a function named quadratic () which uses these numbers and returns the two roots of the equation according to the formulas (– b + sqrt (b2 - 4ac)) / (2a) and (–b - sqrt (b2 - 4ac)) / (2a).
