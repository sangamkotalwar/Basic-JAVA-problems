The marks of students in a College exam are listed in a file called marks.dat. One line contains one mark, ranging between 0 and 100.
Test scores are assigned as follows:
Marks >= 90 A 
80 <= Marks < 90 B 
65 <= Marks < 80 C 
50 <= Marks < 65 D 
Marks < 50 F 
Write a Java program which reads the file marks.dat, and reports:
 1) The number of students who received A, B, C, D and F grades, respectively.
2) The percentage of students receiving each letter grade.
Test your program by creating a 30-line test file containing 30 marks between 0 – 100.
