A string of arbitrary length and consisting only of the lowercase alphabetical characters is given to you, for example:
“qwsdefwugvdcerihfawvbnehsttyuioplkjhgfdsazxugbcvblohnmnhtojhgdsvbfcde”
An int array numbersOfLetters [26] is also given. Write a program which populates the array with the number of a’s b’s, c’s etc. present in the string. Thus numbersOfLetters [0] is 2, because 2 a’s are present, and numbersOfLetters [25] is 1 because only 1 ‘z’ is present.
